  This is a Project Planner App made using React, Redux and Firestore. Used
  Thunk as a middleware to return function so we can make async call in action
  creators. Firebase(firestore) as a realtime (NoSQL) database to store all the
  data inside, used Cloud Functions for notifications. FirebaseAuth and Firebase
  allows us to control over users or devices using secure JSON Web Tokens
  (JWTs). Used materialize CSS cdn for styling, and Hosted using the same
  firebase. *** Can sign up to test using any dummy email id and password.
